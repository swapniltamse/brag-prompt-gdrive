**BragPrompt – Reflect on Your Daily Wins**

**Short description:**
A simple daily nudge to help you track what you did that mattered—fight imposter syndrome, one note at a time.

**Full Description:**
BragPrompt is a lightweight Chrome extension that pops up once a day and asks:
“What did you do today that mattered?”

That’s it.

Your answer is quietly saved to a private Google Doc in your Drive. No judgments. No analytics. Just a habit that helps you reflect, build confidence, and grow your personal brag document over time.

Whether you're an engineer, designer, PM, or student—this tool is designed for those of us who sometimes forget how much we actually do.

**Why BragPrompt?**

Beat imposter syndrome with daily reflection

Build your brag doc effortlessly, without pressure

Capture small wins before they fade

Private, secure, and personal—stored on your own Drive

Perfect for performance reviews, job interviews, or simply recognizing your growth.

Open-source. No tracking. Just you and your work.
